### Project Overview

 Conduct an EDA on the Google Play Store data and try to explore whether given the data, ratings of an can be predicted.Google Play Store serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications. Success of an app is largely determined by its ratings.

But is there any particular pattern among high rated apps? Does size or genre of the app play a role in determining its high rating?

Let's find out.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, i got  better understanding of certain methods of EDA and Data Preprocessing. In this project, i learned following concepts.

1) Removing Missing Values
2) Cleaning Data
3) Exploring Data through various plots


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 following steps i took to get better analysis:

1) Data loading and plotted histogram of "Rating" column to see distribution of app rating
2) Finding Null value and their treatment
3) Finding correlation between " install " and " rating " , observed same using seaborn regplot
4) Finding correlation between " Price " and " rating " , observed same using seaborn regplot
5) Finding correlation between " Genre " and " rating " , observed same using seaborn regplot
6) Finding correlation between " Last Update " and " rating " , observed same using seaborn regplot



### Challenges faced

 finding correlation between various features was a challenge , but regplot is used to resolve the problem.
