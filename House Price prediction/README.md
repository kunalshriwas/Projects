### Project Overview

 Your friend from Iowa, whose housing problem you solved, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. As you have solved his Iowa housing problem so well, he wants you to solve his Melbourne housing problem too. Armed with your new-found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.
Main goal was to predict price of a house.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, i have a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, i learned following concepts.

1)Train-test split

2)Correlation between the features

3)Linear Regression

4)Polynomial Regressor

5)Lasso Regressor

5)Ridge Regressor

6) Evaluation Metrics R^2


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 my opproach for the project is as follows:
1) loading dataset and spliting it into training and testing dataset
2)prediction using Linear regression model
3)prediction using LASSO
4)prediction using RIDGE
6)prediction using cross validation
7)prediction using polynomial regressor
8) R^2 score is used as an evaluation matrics


### Challenges faced

 for Prediction there are many regression mdels available. but by using evauation matrics that issue is resolved
