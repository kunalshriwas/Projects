# L & T Finance 

Problem Statement:
Here we had to predict weather if given a loan to a particular person will he/she will default in
paying back the loan or not. In this based on various data parameters in the data set like age
gender, past credit history loan amount etc we predicted the number of people that could
potentially default in paying back the loan.
