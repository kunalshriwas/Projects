### Project Overview

 You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. Since (luckily!), you are a data scientist in the making, you wished to solve this problem yourself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.




### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, i learned  how to build a linear regression model and following concepts were cleared

1)Train-test split
2)Correlation between the features
3)Linear Regression
4)MSE and R^2 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 following steps are taken :
1) loaded Dataset and splitting it into train and test
2) correlation between features are found
3)  Linear Regession model is applied
4)  MSE and R^2 Evaluation method is used
5)  Based on distance between true target and predicted target  , the cost function is defined
